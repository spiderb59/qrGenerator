**Visitor Pass Generator**

This is a visitor pass generator embedded with QR generation which holds the data for visitor.

### Installation

Will add once completed. 

### Features (Upcoming)

- **Visitor Pass:** Soon, additional features will be added to the QR generator. Users will be able to add details such as name and time the QR code was generated, and this information will be embedded into the QR code. The generated QR code will serve as a visitor pass. (Created) 
  
- **Scan Recording:** When the QR code is scanned, the data will be stored in a database in another application. This will allow for recording the time of each scan.

- **Usage Restrictions:** The visitor pass QR code will have certain usage restrictions. It will only be valid for the day it is created and cannot be scanned successfully for a certain number of times within an hour. Additionally, there will be a maximum limit on the number of scans allowed per day.

### Development

This project is developed using HTML and CSS only. It utilizes the QR code generation library hosted on [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious).

A separate branch named `develop` will be used to implement the upcoming features.
